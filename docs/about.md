# About This Course

## Prerequisites

**Basic Computer Skills:** Students should be comfortable with basic computer operations, including installing software, navigating file systems, and general internet usage.

**Familiarity with ChatGPT and AI Concepts:** A basic understanding of artificial intelligence, machine learning, and specifically ChatGPT. This could include how AI models are trained and the general capabilities and limitations of language models.

**Programming Knowledge:** Since LangChain involves working with APIs and possibly coding for integration, a foundational knowledge of programming (preferably in Python) is essential. This should include understanding of basic programming concepts like variables, loops, functions, and data structures.

**GitHub Experience:** Basic familiarity with Git and GitHub, including cloning repositories, committing changes, and understanding version control concepts.

## Adaptive Learning

Our goal is to provide content for multiple learning pathways.  Students who are new to generative AI can focus on less technical topics such
as prompt engineering.

Students with a strong mastery of Python and machine learning can focus
on topics such as building knowledge graphs to support intelligent agents
that facilitate adaptive learning.
