# Decomposition

The goal of this week is to learn how to use GPT-4 along with the process of decomposing large problems into a set of smaller problems.
If we assume that GPT-4 can write about 50 lines of p5.js code at
a time, how do we break a large program into smaller functions?

## Examples

2. [Signals and Systems](./02a-decomposition-analog.md)
3. [Digital Logic Gates](./02c-decomposition-logic-gates.md)
