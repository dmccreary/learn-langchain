# Decomposition for Signals & Systems Course

I am a college professor teaching an undergraduate electrical engineering course called "Signals & Systems".
This class covers the basic techniques for analyzing and designing signal processing, communications, and control systems. Topics include time/frequency models, Fourier-domain representations, modulation, discrete-time/digital signal/system analysis, Z transform, state models, stability, and feedback. 

I recently found a tool that makes it very easy
to build interactive simulations where the users
can control the simulation parameters using buttons
and sliders.  What are the most difficult topics
to explain in an undergraduate above?
Please list the possible simulations and order the results based on the probability that I can create an interactive simulation to explain the concept.
