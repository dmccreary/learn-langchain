It combines elements of graph theory with machine learning to process and analyze data that contains complex relationships and interdependencies. This approach is useful in various applications such as social network analysis, recommendation systems, and fraud detection, where data points are interrelated in non-trivial ways.

#### Lesson Plan
A Lesson Plan is a teacher's detailed description of the course of instruction for a class. A well-crafted lesson plan outlines the objectives, teaching and learning activities, and resources needed to carry out a particular lesson. It serves as a guide for teachers to manage the learning environment and ensure consistent coverage of curriculum and fulfillment of learning objectives.

#### LLMs (Large Language Models)
LLMs, or Large Language Models, are advanced AI models trained on vast datasets to understand, interpret, and generate human language. Examples include OpenAI's GPT (Generative Pre-trained Transformer) series.

#### Neural Network
A Neural Network is a computational model inspired by the structure of the human brain. It consists of interconnected nodes, or 'neurons,' organized in layers. Each connection can transmit a signal from one neuron to another. The receiving neuron processes the signal and signals downstream neurons connected to it. Neural networks are used in machine learning for pattern recognition and data classification, among other tasks.

#### Deep Neural Network
A Deep Neural Network (DNN) is an advanced type of neural network that contains multiple hidden layers between the input and output layers. Each layer of neurons refines the information processed by the previous layer, allowing the network to learn and make sense of complex data with high levels of abstraction and accuracy. DNNs are the foundation of deep learning and are particularly powerful in handling large and complex datasets.

#### Prompt Engineering
Prompt Engineering is the process of designing and refining the input (or 'prompt') given to a language model to elicit the most accurate or relevant output. It involves creatively framing the prompt and including specific instructions or context that guide the model's response. Effective prompt engineering is crucial for maximizing the performance of language models, especially in applications like chatbots, content creation, and problem-solving.

#### Context Window
The Context Window in natural language processing refers to the amount of text (in terms of words or tokens) that a language model can consider at one time when generating a response or prediction. This window defines the scope of the model's immediate understanding. In large language models like GPT-3, the context window determines how much prior text is used to inform the model's current output.

#### GPU (Graphics Processing Unit)
A GPU, or Graphics Processing Unit, is a specialized processor designed to accelerate graphics rendering. GPUs are also widely used in the field of deep learning and AI, as they can process multiple parallel tasks efficiently, making them ideal for training complex neural networks and handling large-scale data processing.

#### RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation)
Retrieval-Augmented Generation is a method combining a retrieval system with a generative language model. It enhances the language model's responses by retrieving relevant information from a database or document collection.

#### Semantic Search
Semantic Search refers to a search technique that aims to understand the searcher's intent and the contextual meaning of terms as they appear in the searchable dataspace. It contrasts with keyword search, which looks for exact matches of the query words without understanding the context or meaning behind them. Semantic search, often powered by AI and natural language understanding, provides more relevant search results by understanding the intent and contextual meaning of the search query.

#### Similarity
In the context of machine learning and LangChain, similarity refers to the measure of how closely related two items are in their representations, often used with embeddings. This concept is crucial in tasks like semantic search, where the goal is to find items (e.g., documents, images) that are similar or relevant to a query, based on their vector representations in the embedding space.

#### Socratic Method
The Socratic Method is a form of cooperative argumentative dialogue between individuals, based on asking and answering questions to stimulate critical thinking and to draw out ideas and underlying presuppositions. It is named after the Classical Greek philosopher Socrates and is used to promote a deeper understanding of complex ideas.

#### Tokenization
Tokenization is the process of converting text into smaller units, called tokens. In natural language processing, tokens usually represent words, but they can also include punctuation marks, numbers, and other characters. Tokenization is a fundamental step in text processing, allowing models to understand and manipulate text by breaking it down into manageable pieces. It's essential for tasks like sentiment analysis, language translation, and text generation.

#### Training vs Inference
In the context of machine learning, 'Training' refers to the process of teaching a model to make predictions or decisions, typically by feeding it a large set of labeled data. 'Inference,' on the other hand, is the stage where the trained model is used to make predictions on new, unseen data. Training is a compute-intensive process that adjusts the model's parameters, while inference involves applying these parameters to make quick decisions or analysis.

#### Vector Stores
Vector stores are specialized databases designed to efficiently store and retrieve high-dimensional data, such as vectors produced by machine learning models. They are essential in tasks like similarity search and recommendation systems.

#### Visual Studio Code
Visual Studio Code (VS Code) is a free, open-source code editor developed by Microsoft. It's widely used by developers due to its support for a variety of programming languages, built-in Git integration, debugging tools, and a vast ecosystem of extensions. VS Code is known for its lightweight design, cross-platform availability, and powerful code editing and navigation capabilities.
