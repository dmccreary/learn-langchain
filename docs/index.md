# Building Education Intelligent Agents With LangChain

This microsite supports a course on building intelligent agents
using the Python LangChain libraries to support education.

We believe that LLM-powered agents are an excellent foundation for 
building general problem-solving agents and will be at the core of most educational 
learning management systems in a few years.  Central to this
philosophy is to empower agents to do planning, access relevant knowledge, 
work with other agents, and cost-effectively use resources such as API and data queries.


We use LangChain to build intelligent agents that can:

1. Generate lesson plans customized to the needs of a specific student
2. Generate micro-simulations that provide interactive animations
3. Generate supporting classroom materials such as concept glossaries and quizzes that are contextualized to each students learning objectives

We use examples that support teachers in K-12 education generating
customizable simulations and lesson plans customized to each
student.

We are fully aware that LangChain is not a perfect solution.
It is a dynamically evolving framework with almost daily
releases that break our code.  Despite this challenge, it
is the best that we have today.

the course prerequisites and goals.  If you are using
