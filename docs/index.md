# Building Education Intelligent Agents With LangChain

This microsite supports a course on building intelligent agents
using the Python LangChain libraries to support education.

We use LangChain to build intelligent agents that can:

1. Generate lesson plans customized to the needs of a specific student
2. Generate micro-simulations that provide interactive animations
3. Generate supporting classroom materials such as concept glossaries and quizzes that are contextualized to each students learning objectives

We use examples that support teachers in K-12 education generating
customizable simulations and lesson plans customized to each
student.

Please read the [About Page](./about.md) for details on
the course prerequisites and goals.  If you are using
these materials in your own classes, be sure
to read the [Creative Commons License](.license.md) page.
