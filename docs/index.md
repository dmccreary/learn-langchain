# Building Intelligent Agents With LangChain

This microsite supports a course on building intelligent agents
using the Python LangChain libraries.

We use LangChain to build intelligent agents.

We use examples that support teachers in K-12 education generating
customizable simulations and lesson plans customized to each
student.

Please read the [About Page](./about.md) for details on
the course prerequisites and goals.  If you are using
