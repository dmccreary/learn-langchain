This could include how AI models are trained and the general capabilities and limitations of language models.</p> <p>Programming Knowledge: Since LangChain involves working with APIs and possibly coding for integration, a foundational knowledge of programming (preferably in Python) is essential. This should include understanding of basic programming concepts like variables, loops, functions, and data structures.</p> <p>GitHub Experience: Basic familiarity with Git and GitHub, including cloning repositories, committing changes, and understanding version control concepts.</p>"},{"location":"contacts/","title":"Contact","text":""},{"location":"contacts/#primary-contact","title":"Primary Contact","text":"<p>Dan McCreary on LinkedIn</p>"},{"location":"contacts/#collaborators","title":"Collaborators","text":"<p>Sharat Batra batra052@umn.edu</p>"},{"location":"env-test/","title":"Testing Your Environment","text":"<p>jupyter-env-test</p> <p>OPENAI_API_KEY=\"...\" PINECONE_API_KEY=\"...\" PINECONE_ENV=\"...\"</p>"},{"location":"how-we-built-this-site/","title":"How We Built This Site","text":"<p>This page describes how we built this website and some of  the rationale behind why we made various design choices.</p>"},{"location":"how-we-built-this-site/#python","title":"Python","text":"<p>LangChain is about how we use generative AI to  harness the power of generative AI and Large-Language Models.

We don't currently have this action enabled, but other teams can use this feature if they don't have the ability to do a local build with mkdocs.</p> <p>GitHub also has Issues,  Projects and releases that we can use to manage our bugs and tasks.</p> <p>The best practice for low-cost websites that have public-only content is GitHub Pages.

No other theme had over a few hundred. This was also an easy design decision.</p> <p>One key criterial was the social Open Graph tags so that when our users post a link to a simulation, the image of the simulation is included in the link.

This is a work in progress!</p> <p>Here is what we have learned.</p> <ol> <li>There are extensive image processing libraries that can't be installed with just pip.  You will need to run a tool like brew on the Mac to get the libraries installed.</li> <li>Even after <code>brew</code> installs the libraries, you have to get your environment to find the libraries.  The only way I could get that to work was to set up a local UNIX environment variable.</li> </ol> <p>Here is the brew command that I ran:</p> <pre><code>brew install cairo freetype libffi libjpeg libpng zlib\n</code></pre> <p>I then had to add the following to my ~/.zshrc file:</p> <pre><code>export DYLD_FALLBACK_LIBRARY_PATH=/opt/homebrew/lib\n</code></pre> <p>Note that I am running on a Mac with Apple silicon.
