Mkdocs is easier to use and more popular than Docusaurus. Docusaurus is also optimized for single-page applications. Mkdocs also has an extensive library of themes and plugins. None of us are experts in JavaScript or React. Based on our ChatGPT Analysis of the Tradeoffs we chose mkdocs for this site management.</p>"},{"location":"how-we-built-this-site/#github-and-github-pages","title":"GitHub and GitHub Pages","text":"<p>GitHub is a logical choice to store our  site source code and documentation.  GitHub also has a Custom GitHub Action that does auto-deployment if any files on the site change. We don't currently have this action enabled, but other teams can use this feature if they don't have the ability to do a local build with mkdocs.</p> <p>GitHub also has Issues,  Projects and releases that we can use to manage our bugs and tasks.</p> <p>The best practice for low-cost websites that have public-only content is GitHub Pages. Mkdocs has a command (<code>mkdocs gh-deploy</code>) that does deployment directly to GitHub Pages.  This was an easy choice to make.</p>"},{"location":"how-we-built-this-site/#github-clone","title":"GitHub Clone","text":"<p>If you would like to clone this repository, here are the commands:</p> <pre><code>mkdir projects\ncd projects\ngit clone https://github.com/dmccreary/learn-langchain\n</code></pre>"},{"location":"how-we-built-this-site/#after-changes","title":"After Changes","text":"<p>After you make local changes you must do the following:</p> <pre><code># add the new files to a a local commit transaction\ngit add FILES\n# Execute the a local commit with a message about what and why you are doing the commit\ngit commit -m \"comment\"\n# Update the central GitHub repository\ngit push\n</code></pre>"},{"location":"how-we-built-this-site/#material-theme","title":"Material Theme","text":"<p>We had several options when picking a mkdocs theme:</p> <ol> <li>Mkdocs default</li> <li>Readthedocs</li> <li>Third-Party Themes See Ranking</li> </ol> <p>The Material Theme had 16K stars.  No other theme had over a few hundred. This was also an easy design decision.</p> <p>One key criterial was the social Open Graph tags so that when our users post a link to a simulation, the image of the simulation is included in the link.  Since Material supported this, we used the Material theme.

We can use the native Python venv or use Conda.  venv is simle but is only designed for pure Python projects.  We imagine that this site could use JavaScript and other langauges in the future, so we picked Conda. There is nothing on this microsite that prevents you from using one or the other.

This is a work in progress!</p> <p>Here is what we have learned.</p> <ol> <li>There are extensive image processing libraries that can't be installed with just pip.  You will need to run a tool like brew on the Mac to get the libraries installed.</li> <li>Even after <code>brew</code> installs the libraries, you have to get your environment to find the libraries.  The only way I could get that to work was to set up a local UNIX environment variable.</li> </ol> <p>Here is the brew command that I ran:</p> <pre><code>brew install cairo freetype libffi libjpeg libpng zlib\n</code></pre> <p>I then had to add the following to my ~/.zshrc file:</p> <pre><code>export DYLD_FALLBACK_LIBRARY_PATH=/opt/homebrew/lib\n</code></pre> <p>Note that I am running on a Mac with Apple silicon.
